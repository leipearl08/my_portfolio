    <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
        <p>Hello, I started this new journey of learning web development again. I always admire people who knows their way
        around into programming, specialy after watching animes with characters that are good with technology. I'm hoping this
        time I'll be able to achieve my goals and reach new heights.</p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an introvert, its quite challenging for me to share something to people easily. But I'm doing my
            best to anyone in need.</p>

    <h2>The steps I took</h2>
    <p>In order for me to regain the lost opportunity to pursue a career as a Sofware Developer, I joined KodeGO
        with the hope of finding the correct path back to programming.</p>

    <h3>That's all for now! Matta Ashita</h3>
